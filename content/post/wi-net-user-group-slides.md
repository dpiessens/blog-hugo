Thank you to everyone who attended my talk at the [WI .NET User group](http://www.wi-ineta.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=23 "WI .NET User group") last Tuesday. I posted the slides from the event below.

I also wanted to let everyone know that if you're interested in a career at [Centare](http://www.centare.com/careers/current-opportunities "Centare") or want to attend any of the other great events we put on, check out the [Centare Events page](http://www.centare.com/events/ "Centare Events page")!
